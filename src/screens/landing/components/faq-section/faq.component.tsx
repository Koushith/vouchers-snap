      <Item title="Who should use Safient voucher?">
        Are you looking to gift crypto assets to someone? Do you want to send
        crypto to someone but don't have their wallet address?
        {' '}
        <br />
        We got you covered ðŸ¤—. Safient Voucher can do it with ease and safety.
      </Item>
      <Item title="How is it different than other Crypto voucher services?">
        Many available crypto vouchers are custodial. Safient voucher is a
        non-custodial voucher without going through any intermediary before
        someone redeems it.
      </Item>
      <Item title="Does the voucher have expiry date?">
        Yes, but it's entirely up to the voucher creator to set all the
        restrictions of voucher redemption. We provide plenty of options to
        choose from.
      </Item>
      <Item title="What happens after I redeem the voucher?">
        The voucher redemption gives access to the crypto and they can spend
        however they wish. But for better management, we will also provide
        several integrations to other services.
      </Item>
      <Item title="Why is there an early access program?">
        Although we want everyone to access it soon, we want to make sure we
        give out the best version to everyone by inviting a few people to access
        it first.
